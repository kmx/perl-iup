=head1 NAME

IUP::Scintilla - [GUI element] multiline source code text editor (based on Scintilla library)

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Creates a multiline source code text editor that uses the Scintilla
library.

Scintilla is a free library that provides text-editing functions, with
an emphasis on advanced features for source code editing. It is available
on L<http://www.scintilla.org|http://www.scintilla.org>.

L<IUP::Scintilla> includes the Scintilla 3.4.4 source code, so no
external references are needed.

Supported in Windows and in the systems the GTK driver is supported.

=head1 USAGE

=head2 CREATION - new() method

 $fill = IUP::Scintilla->new( EXPAND=>'YES' );
 
B<Returns:> the identifier of the created element, or C<undef> if an error occurs.

NOTE: You can pass to C<new()> other C<ATTRIBUTE=E<gt>'value'> or C<CALLBACKNAME=E<gt>\&func> pairs relevant
to this element - see L<IUP::Manual::02_Elements|IUP::Manual::02_Elements/"new()">.

=head2 ATTRIBUTES

For more info about concept of attributes (setting/getting values etc.)
see L<IUP::Manual::03_Attributes|IUP::Manual::03_Attributes>. Attributes specific to this element:

=head3 General

=over

=item * B<BORDER> (creation only)

Shows a border around the text. Default: "YES".

=item * B<CANFOCUS> (creation only) (non inheritable)

enables the focus traversal of the control. In Windows the control will still get the
focus when clicked. Default: YES.

=item * B<CLIPBOARD> (non inheritable)

clear, cut, copy or paste the selection
to or from the clipboard. Values: "CLEAR", "CUT", "COPY", "PASTE".
Returns Yes or No, if data can be pasted from the clipboard.

=item * B<CURSOR> (non inheritable)

defines the cursor type. Can be: "NORMAL"
or "WAIT" (displays a wait cursor when the mouse is over or owned by the control).

=item * B<DROPFILESTARGET> [Windows and GTK Only] (non inheritable)

Enable or disable the drop of files. Default: NO, but if DROPFILES_CB is defined
when the element is mapped then it will be automatically enabled.

=item * B<KEYSUNICODE> [Windows Only] (non inheritable)

allow processing of Unicode typed characters. Default: NO. (since 3.9)

=item * B<OVERWRITE> (non inheritable)

turns the overwrite mode ON or OFF.
When enabled, each typed character replaces the character to the right
of the text caret. When disabled, characters are inserted at the caret.

=item * B<READONLY> (non inheritable)

Allows the user only to read the
contents, without changing it. Restricts the insertion using keyboard
input and attributes. Navigation keys are still available. 
Possible values: "YES" and "NO". Default: NO.

=item * B<SAVEDSTATE> (non inheritable)

sets the current state of
the document to saved (given value is ignored), returns Yes or No if
the document has been modified. After setting the SAVEDSTATE, when
editing is done the L<SAVEPOINT_CB> callback is called
with status=0. When undo is performed back to the point were the saved
state was set the callback is called again with status=1.

=item * L<SIZE|IUP::Manual::03_Attributes/SIZE> (non inheritable)

Since the contents
can be changed by the user, the B<Natural> B<Size> is not affected by
the text contents. In IUP 2.x the B<Natural> B<Size> was defined by the
number of lines in the text and the with of the largest line. For IUP
3, use VISIBLECOLUMNS and VISIBLELINES to control the B<Natural Size>.

=item * B<USEPOPUP> (non inheritable)

allows to disable the default editing
menu shown when the user clicks with the right button. Default: Yes.

=item * B<VISIBLECOLUMNS>

Defines the number of visible columns for the
B<Natural Size>, this means that will act also as minimum number of
visible columns. It uses a wider character size then the one used for
the SIZE attribute so strings will fit better without the need of extra
columns. As for SIZE you can set to NULL after map to use it as an
initial value. 

Default: 50.

=item * B<VISIBLELINES>

Defines the number of visible lines for the B<Natural Size>, this means that will act also as minimum number of visible
lines. As for SIZE you can set to NULL after map to use it as an initial value. 

Default: 10.

=item * B<VISIBLELINESCOUNT> (non inheritable, read-only)

returns the number of actual visible lines.

=item * B<WORDWRAP> (non inheritable)

If enabled will force a word wrap of
lines that are greater than the with of the control, and the horizontal
scrollbar will be removed. Default: NO.

=item * B<WORDWRAPVISUALFLAGS> (non inheritable)

enable the drawing of visual
flags to indicate a line is wrapped. Can be: MARGIN (at the line number
margin), START (start of wrapped line), END (end of wrapped line) or
NONE. Default: NONE.

=back

in the document. It uses a string format "B<pos,len>" in order to
indicate the start position and text length to delete.

=item * B<INSERT(id)> (non inheritable, write-only)

Inserts a text string at
position "id" or at the current position if pos is -1 or omitted. If
the current position is after the insertion point then it is moved
along with its surrounding text but no scrolling is performed.

=item * B<LINE(id)> (non inheritable, read-only)

will be automatically inserted after the prepended text if the current
text is not empty (APPENDNEWLINE default is YES).

=item * B<VALUE> (non inheritable)

Text entered by the user. The "\n"
character indicates a new line. After the element is mapped and if

=back

=head3 Annotation

=over

=item * B<ANNOTATIONTEXT(id)> (non inheritable)

style', which is defined as style number (See L<Style
Definition|#StyleDefinition>, id = 34).

=item * B<BRACEBADLIGHT> (non inheritable, write only)

highlights the non
matching brace, based on a position. If there is no matching brace then
the brace badlighting style (See L<Style Definition|#StyleDefinition>,

matching brace cannot be found, the return value is -1.

=back

=head3 Caret and Selection

=over

=item * B<CARET> (non inheritable)

The first position, B<lin> or B<col>, is "0". It uses a string format
"B<lin>,B<col>" in order to indicate the caret position, where B<lin>
and B<col> must be integer numbers.

When B<lin> is greater than the number of lines, the caret is placed at
the last line. When B<col> is greater than the number of characters in
the given line, the caret is placed after the last character of the
line.

If the caret is not visible the text is scrolled to make it visible.

=item * B<CARETPOS> (non inheritable)

=item * B<SELECTION> (non inheritable)

Selection interval. Returns NULL if
there is no selection. The first position, B<lin> or B<col>, is "0".
The accepted format is represented by the string

B<col2> correspond to the character after the last selected character.
The values ALL and NONE are also accepted.

B<SELECTIONPOS> (non inheritable)

Same as SELECTION but using a zero
based character index "B<pos1>:B<pos2>". Useful for indexing the VALUE
string. The values ALL and NONE are also accepted.

level is useful to decide how to handle user folding requests.

=item * B<FOLDTOGGLE> (non inheritable, write-only)

Determines if the fold
point (line number) may be either expanded, displaying all its child
lines, or contracted, hiding all the child lines.

you can set, other than available memory. To retrieve a property first
set the PROPERTYNAME attribute, the PROPERTY attribute will return its
value.

=item * B<PROPERTYNAMES> (non inheritable, read only)

returns a list of

=head3 Auxiliary Functions

L<IUP::Text|IUP::Text> auxiliary functions C<TextConvertLinColToPos> and C<TextConvertPosToLinCol> can be used.

=head3 Style Definition

Scintilla can automatically format the text using the Lexer or the
application can manually format the text. In both cases only 256
different styles are available. Styles are numbered from 0 to 255,
invalid IDs are simply ignored. When the id is not specified for an
attributes the style 0 is assumed.

Each Lexer will use the available styles with its own rules, but
several Lexers share many ids. Notice that language keywords and styles
definitions are not pre-defined internally, the application must define
them.

 ID      Global styles
 ======  ==================================================================
 32      This style defines the attributes that all styles receive
         when the STYLECLEARALL attribute is used.
 33      This style sets the attributes of the text used to display
         line numbers in a line number margin.
 34      This style sets the attributes used when highlighting braces
         with the BRACEHIGHLIGHT and HIGHLIGHTGUIDE attributes.
 35      This style sets the attributes used when marking an unmatched
         brace with the BRACEBADLIGHT attribute.
 36      This style sets the font used when drawing control characters.
 37      This style sets the foreground and background colors used when
         drawing the indentation guides. Used when INDENTATIONGUIDES!=NONE.
