=head1 USAGE

=head2 CREATION - new() method

 $filedlg = IUP::FileDlg->new( DIALOGTYPE=>"OPEN" );

B<Returns:> the identifier of the created element, or C<undef> if an error occurs.

NOTE: You can pass to C<new()> other C<ATTRIBUTE=E<gt>'value'> or C<CALLBACKNAME=E<gt>\&func> pairs relevant
to this element - see L<IUP::Manual::02_Elements|IUP::Manual::02_Elements/"new()">.

=head2 ATTRIBUTES

For more info about concept of attributes (setting/getting values etc.)
see L<IUP::Manual::03_Attributes|IUP::Manual::03_Attributes>. Attributes specific to this element:

=over

=item B<ALLOWNEW>

Indicates if non-existent file names are accepted. If
equals "NO" and the user specifies a non-existing file, an alert dialog
is shown. Default: if the dialog is of type "OPEN", default is "NO"; if
the dialog is of type "SAVE", default is "YES". Not used when
DIALOGTYPE=DIR.

=item B<DIALOGTYPE>

Type of dialog (Open, Save or Directory). Can have
values "OPEN", "SAVE" or "DIR". Default: "OPEN".

In Windows, when DIALOGTYPE=DIR the dialog shown is not the same dialog
for OPEN and SAVE, this new dialog does not have the Help button
neither filters. Also this new dialog needs CoInitializeEx with
COINIT_APARTMENTTHREADED (done in L<IUP::Open|IUP::Open>), if the COM library was
initialized with COINIT_MULTITHREADED prior to L<IUP::Open|IUP::Open> then the new
dialog will have limited functionality. In Motif or GTK the dialog is
the same, but it only allows the user to select a directory.

=item B<DIRECTORY>

Initial directory. When consulted after the dialog is
closed and the user pressed the OK button, it will contain the
directory of the selected file.

In Motif or GTK, if not defined the dialog opens in the current
directory.

In Windows, if not defined and the application has used the dialog in
the past, the path most recently used is selected as the initial
directory. However, if an application is not run for a long time, its
saved selected path is discarded. Also if not defined and the current
directory contains any files of the specified filter types, the initial
directory is the current directory. Otherwise, the initial directory is
the "My Documents" directory of the current user. Otherwise, the
initial directory is the Desktop folder.

=item B<EXTFILTER>

I<[Windows and GTK Only]> Defines several file filters. It
has priority over FILTERINFO and FILTER. Must be a text with the format
"FilterInfo1|Filter1|FilterInfo2|Filter2|...". The list ends with
character '|'. Example: "Text files|*.txt;*.doc|Image
files|*.gif;*.jpg;*.bmp|". In GTK there is no way how to overwrite the
filters, so it is recommended to always add a less restrictive filter
to the filter list, for example "All Files|*.*".

=item B<FILE>

Name of the file initially shown in the "File Name" field in
the dialog. If contains a path, then it is used as the initial
directory and B<DIRECTORY> is ignored.

=item B<FILEEXIST>

I<(read-only)> Indicates if the file defined by the FILE
attribute exists or not. It is only valid if the user has pressed OK in
the dialog. Not set when DIALOGTYPE=DIR or B<MULTIPLEFILES=YES>.

=item B<FILTER>

String containing a list of file filters separated by ';'
without spaces. Example: "*.C;*.LED;test.*". In Motif only the first
filter is used.

=item B<FILTERINFO>

I<[Windows and GTK Only]> Filter's description. If not
defined the filter itself will be used as its description.

=item B<FILTERUSED>

I<[Windows and GTK Only]> the index of the filter in
EXTFILTER to use starting at 1. It returns the selection made by the
user. Set only if EXTFILTER is defined.

=item B<MULTIPLEFILES>

When "YES", this attribute allows the user to select
multiple files when DIALOGTYPE=OPEN. The value returned by VALUE is to
be changed the following way: the directory and the files are passed
separately, in this order. The character used for separating the
directory and the files is '|'. The file list ends with character '|'.
When the user selects just one file, the directory and the file are not
separated by '|'. For example:

 "/tecgraf/iup/test|a.txt|b.txt|c.txt|"
 or
 "/tecgraf/iup/test/a.txt" (only one file is selected)

In Windows the maximum size allowed for file name returned is 65Kb.

=item B<NOCHANGEDIR>

Indicates if the current working directory must be
restored after the user navigation. Default: "YES".

=item B<NOOVERWRITEPROMPT>

do not prompt to overwrite an existent file when
in "SAVE" dialog. Default is "NO", i.e. prompt before overwrite. (GTK
2.8)

=item L<PARENTDIALOG|IUP::Manual::03_Attributes/PARENTDIALOG>

Makes the dialog be
treated as a child of the specified dialog.

=item B<SHOWHIDDEN>

Show hidden files. Default: NO.  (GTK 2.6)

=item B<SHOWPREVIEW>

A preview area is shown inside the File Dialog. Can
have values "YES" or "NO". Default: "NO". In Windows, you must link
with the "iup.rc" resource file so the preview area can be enabled (not
necessary if using "iup.dll"). Valid only if the FILE_CB callback is
defined, use it to retrieve the file name and the necessary attributes
to paint the preview area. (in Motif since iup-3.0)

Read only attributes that are valid inside the FILE_CB callback when
status="PAINT":

=item B<PREVIEWDC>

Returns the Device Context (HDC in Windows and GC in
UNIX)

=item B<PREVIEWWIDTH>

=item B<PREVIEWHEIGHT>

Returns the width and the height of the client rectangle for the preview area.

Also the attributes WID, HWND, XWINDOW and XDISPLAY are valid and
are relative to the preview area.

If the attribute PREVIEWGLCANVAS is defined then it is used as the name
of an existent IUP::GLCanvas control to be mapped internally to the
preview canvas. Notice that this is not a fully implemented IUP::GLCanvas
that inherits from IUP::Canvas. This does the minimum necessary so you
can use IUP::GLCanvas auxiliary functions for the preview canvas and call
OpenGL functions. No IUP::Canvas attributes or callbacks are available.

=item B<STATUS>

I<(read-only)> Indicates the status of the selection made:

 "1"   New file.
 "0"   Normal, existing file or directory.
 "-1"  Operation cancelled.

=item L<TITLE|IUP::Manual::03_Attributes/TITLE>

Dialog's title.

=item B<VALUE>

I<(read-only)> Name of the selected file(s), or C<undef> if no file
was selected. If FILE is not defined this is used as the initial value.
In Windows there is a limit of 32Kb for this string.

=back

=head2 CALLBACKS

For more info about concept of callbacks (setting callback handlers etc.)
see L<IUP::Manual::04_Callbacks|IUP::Manual::04_Callbacks>. Callbacks specific to this element:

=over

=item B<FILE_CB>

Action generated when a file is selected. Not called when
DIALOGTYPE=DIR. When MULTIPLEFILES=YES it is called only for one file.
Can be used with SHOWPREVIEW=NO also. (Windows only in 2.x)

B<Callback handler prototype:>

 sub file_cb_handler {
   my ($self, $file_name, $status) = @_;
   #...
 }

=over

B<$self:> reference to the element (IUP::FileDlg) that activated the event

B<$file_name:> name of the file selected.

B<$status:> describes the action. Can be:

=over

=item * "INIT" - when the dialog has started. $file_name is C<undef>.

=item * "FINISH" - when the dialog is closed. $file_name is C<undef>.

=item * "SELECT" - a file has been selected.

=item * "OTHER" - an invalid file or a directory is selected. $file_name
is the one selected. (Since iup-3.0)

=item * "OK" - the user pressed the OK button. If returns IUP_IGNORE
the action is refused and the dialog is not closed.

=item * "PAINT" - the preview area must be redrawn. Used only when
SHOWPREVIEW=YES. If an invalid file or a directory is selected,
file_name is C<undef>.

=back

=back

=item L<HELP_CB|IUP::Manual::04_Callbacks/HELP_CB>

Action generated when the Help button is pressed.

=back

=head1 NOTES

The L<IUP::FileDlg|IUP::FileDlg> is a native pre-defined dialog that is not altered by
L<SetLanguage|IUP/"SetLanguage()">.

To show the dialog, use function L<Popup|IUP::Manual::02_Elements/"Popup()">.

The dialog is mapped only inside L<Popup|IUP::Manual::02_Elements/"Popup()">, L<Map|IUP::Manual::02_Elements/"Map()"> does nothing.

The L<GetFile|IUP/"GetFile()"> function simply creates and popup a L<IUP::FileDlg>.

In Windows, the FILE and the DIRECTORY attributes also accept strings
containing "/" as path separators, but the VALUE attribute will always
return strings using the "\" character.

In Windows, the dialog will be modal relative only to its parent or to
the active dialog.
