=head2 For Planar Datasets

For all planar modes colors will be used from the previous color scheme
or from COLORSCHEME if defined. COLORSCHEME is a string that can
specify a group of colors to be used by the plot.

Colors in a color scheme are specified by the codes
"wkrgbcymhRGBCYMHWlenupqLENUPQ" only. A brightness weight from 1 to 9
can also be used to change the default value from 5 normal, to 1 very
dark, and to 9 very bright.

Also the symbol d denotes the interpolation by 3D position instead of
the coloring by amplitude. Symbol | disables color interpolation in
color scheme, which can be useful, for example, for sharp colors during
matrix plotting.

For coloring by amplitude (most common) the final color is a linear
interpolation of color array. The color array is constructed from the
string ids. The argument is the amplitude normalized based on
COLORBARRANGE. When coloring by coordinate, the final color is
determined by the position of the point in 3D space and is calculated
from combining the first three elements of color array with the x, y
and z normalizes values. This type of coloring is useful for isosurface
plot where color may show the exact position of a piece of surface.

Here are some examples or color codes and color schemes:
