=head1 MASK (non inheritable) (since 3.0)

Defines a mask that will filter interactive text input.

=head2 Value

string

Set to NULL to remove the mask.

=head2 Notes

Since the validation process is performed key by key when the user is
typing, an intermediate value cannot be typed if it does not follow the
mask rules.

=head2 Auxiliar Attributes

=head2 MASKCASEI (non inheritable)

If YES, will turn the filter case insensitive. Default: NO. Must be set
before MASK.

=head2 MASKINT (non inheritable) (write only)

Defines an integer mask with limits. Format: "%d:%d" ("min:max"). It
will replace MASK.

=head2 MASKFLOAT (non inheritable) (write only)

Defines a floating point mask with limits. Format: "%f:%f" ("min:max").
It will replace MASK.

=head2 Pattern Specification

The pattern to be searched in the text can be defined by the rules
given below.

=over

=item * "Function" codes (such as /l, /D, /w) cannot be used inside a
class ([...]).

=item * If the character following a / does not mean a special case
(such as /w or /n), it is matched with no / - that means that /x will
match only x, and not /x. If you want to match /x, use //x.

=item * The caret (^) character has different meanings when used inside
or outside a class - inside a class it means negative, and outside a
class it is an anchor to the beginning of a line.

=item * The boundary function (/b) anchors the pattern to a word
boundary - it does not match anything. A word boundary is a point
between a /w and a /W character.

=item * Capture operators (f and g) group patterns and are also used to
keep matched sections of texts.

=item * A word on precedence: concatenation has precedence over the
alternation (j) operator - that is, faj fej fi will match fa OR fe OR
fi.

=item * The @ character is used to determine that, instead of searching
the text until the first match is made, the function should try to
match the pattern only with the first character. If present, it must be
the first character of the pattern.

=item * The % character is used to determine that the text should be
searched to its end, independently of the number of matches found. If
present, it must be the first character of the pattern. This is only
useful when combined with the capture feature.

^pattern

Anchors pattern to the beginning of a line

pattern$

Anchors pattern to the end of a line

@pattern

Returns the match found only in the beginning of the text

%pattern

=head2 Examples

(my|his)

/d/d:/d/d(:/d/d)?

Matches time with seconds (01:25:32) or without seconds (02:30).

[A-D]/l+

^Subject:[^/n]*/n

Subject: How to match a subject line.1

/b[ABab]/w*
