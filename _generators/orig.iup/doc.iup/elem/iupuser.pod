=head1 IupUser

Creates a user element in IUP, which is not associated to any interface
element. It is used to map an external element to a IUP element. Its
use is usually done by CPI elements, but you can use it to create an
Ihandle* to store private attributes.

=head2 Creation

 Ihandle* IupUser(void); [in C]
 iup.user{} -> (elem: ihandle) [in Lua]
 user() [in LED]

Returns: the identifier of the created element, or NULL if an error
occurs.

=head2 Attributes

B<CLEARATTRIBUTES> (write-only, non inheritable): it will clear all
attributes stored internally and remove all references. (since 3.0)
