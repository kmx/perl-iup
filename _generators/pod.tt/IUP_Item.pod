Creates an item of the menu interface element. When selected, it
generates an action.

=item B<AUTOTOGGLE> (non inheritable)

Enables the automatic toggle of VALUE
state when the item is activated. Default: NO. 

=item B<HIDEMARK> [Motif and GTK Only]

If enabled the item cannot be
checked, since the check box will not be shown. If all items in a menu
enable it, then no empty space will be shown in front of the items.
Normally the unmarked check box will not be shown, but since GTK 2.14
the unmarked check box is always shown. If your item will not be marked
you must set HIDEMARK=YES, since this is the most common case we
changed the default value to YES for this version of GTK, but if VALUE
is defined the default goes back to NO. Default: NO. 

=item B<IMAGE> [Windows and GTK Only] (non inheritable)

Image name of the
check mark image when VALUE=OFF. In Windows, an item in a menu bar
cannot have a check mark. Ignored if item in a menu bar. A recommended
size would be 16x16 to fit the image in the menu item. In Windows, if
larger than the check mark area it will be cropped.

=item B<IMPRESS> [Windows and GTK Only] (non inheritable)

Image name of the
check mark image when VALUE=ON.

=item L<TITLE|[%m.at%]/TITLE> (non inheritable)

Item text. The "&"
character can be used to define a mnemonic, the next character will be
used as key. Use "&&" to show the "&" character instead on defining a
mnemonic. When in a menu bar an item that has a mnemonic can be
activated from any control in the dialog using the "Alt+key"
combination.

The text also accepts the control character '\t' to force text
alignment to the right after this character. This is used to add
shortcut keys to the menu, aligned to the right, ex: "Save\tCtrl+S",
but notice that the shortcut key (also known as Accelerator or Hot Key)
still has to be implemented. To implement a shortcut use the K_*
callbacks in the dialog.

=item B<TITLEIMAGE> (non inheritable)

Image name of the title image. In
Windows, it appears before of the title text and after the check mark
area (so both title and title image can be visible). In Motif, it must
be at least defined during map, it replaces the text, and only images
will be possible to set (TITLE will be hidden). In GTK, it will appear
on the check mark area. 

=item B<VALUE> (non inheritable)

Indicates the item's state. When the value
is ON, a mark will be displayed to the left of the item. Default: OFF.
An item in a menu bar cannot have a check mark. When IMAGE is used, the
checkmark is not shown. See the item AUTOTOGGLE attribute and the menu
=item L<RADIO|iupmenu.html#RADIO> attribute.

L<WID|[%m.at%]/WID> (non inheritable)

In Windows, returns the HMENU of the parent menu.

Action generated when the item is

IUP_CLOSE is returned, the current popup dialog or the main loop will
be closed.

[% h.notes %]

Menu items are activated using the Enter key.

In Motif and GTK, the text font will be affected by the dialog font
when the menu is mapped.

Since GTK 2.14 to have a menu item that can be marked you must set the
VALUE attribute to ON or OFF, or set HIDEMARK=NO, before mapping the
control.
