[% h.name %]

[% n.iuptree %]

[% h.desc %] 

Creates a tree containing nodes of branches or leaves. Both branches
and leaves can have an associated text and image.

The branches can be expanded or collapsed. When a branch is expanded,
its immediate children are visible, and when it is collapsed they are
hidden.

The leaves can generate an "executed" or "renamed" actions, branches
can only generate a "renamed" action.

The focus node is the node with the focus rectangle, marked nodes have
their background inverted.

=head2 Hierarchy

Branches can contain other branches or leaves. When ADDROOT=Yes the
tree has initially one branch, the B<root>. The first node always has
id=0 and depth=0. The tree nodes have a sequential identification
number (id), starting by the first, with id=0, and increases for each
node independent from the node depth. The following picture illustrates
the numbering of the nodes in a tree.

[IMAGE]

B<Tree nodes and Ids>

Since you have to add each node the creation of this tree can be done
in several ways because the action attributes ADD* and INSERT* use an
existent node to position the new node. The following pseudo code
initializes the tree from top to bottom sequencially:

 TITLE0 = "Figures"
   ADDLEAF0 = "Other"    // Use the previous node as reference
   ADDBRANCH1 = "triangle"
     ADDLEAF2 = "equilateral"
     ADDLEAF3 = "isoceles"
     ADDLEAF4 = "scalenus"
   INSERTBRANCH2 = "parallelogram"  // Use the previous node at the same depth as reference
     ADDLEAF6 = "square"
     ADDLEAF7 = "diamond"
   INSERTBRANCH6 = "2D"
   INSERTBRANCH9 = "3D"

The following pseudo code initializes the tree from bottom to top
sequentially (except for branches), and also uses the focus node:

 VALUE = 0  // Set the focus node at the first (default for a new element)
 TITLE = "Figures"
 ADDBRANCH = "3D"
 ADDBRANCH = "2D"
 ADDBRANCH = "parallelogram"
 ADDLEAF1 = "diamond"
 ADDLEAF1 = "square"
 ADDBRANCH = "triangle"
 ADDLEAF1 = "scalene"
 ADDLEAF1 = "isosceles"
 ADDLEAF1 = "equilateral"
 ADDLEAF = "Other"

Notice that in both cases the initialization of the tree is highly
dependent on the order of the operations. Currently we can NOT garantie
the order before mapping to the native system, so the initialization
must be performed after the tree is mapped.

Scrollbars are automatically displayed if the tree is greater than its
display area.

Branches may be added in IUP::Lua using a Lua Table, see
L<iup.TreeAddNodes|#TreeAddNodes>.

=head2 Manipulation

Node insertion or removal is done by means of attributes. It is allowed
to remove nodes and branches inside callbacks associated to opening or
closing branches.

This means that the user may insert nodes and branches only when
necessary when the parent branch is opened, allowing the use of a
larger IUP::Tree without too much overhead. Then when the parent branch
is closed the subtree can be removed. But the subtree must have at
least 1 node so the branch can be opened and closed, empty branches can
NOT be opened.

=head2 User Data

The node id does not always correspond to the same node as the tree is
modified. For example, an id=2 will always refer to the third node in
the tree, so if you add a node before the third node, the node with
id=2 will now refer to the new node, and the old node will now have
id=3. For that reason, each node can store an user data pointer
uniquely identifying the node. To set or retrieve the user data of a
node use the B<USERDATAid> attribute, or the B<L<Extra
Functions|#Extra_Functions>> below to associate a user data to a node
and to find a node given its user data.

=head2 Images

IUP::Tree has three types of images: one associated to the leaf, one to
the collapsed branch and the other to the expanded branch. Each image
can be changed, both globally and individually.

The predefined images used in IUP::Tree can be obtained by means of
function IUP::GetHandle. The names of the predefined images are: IMGLEAF,
IMGCOLLAPSED, IMGEXPANDED, IMGBLANK (blank sheet of paper) and IMGPAPER
(written sheet of paper). By default:

 "IMAGELEAF" uses "IMGLEAF"
 "IMAGEBRANCHCOLLAPSED" uses "IMGCOLLAPSED"
 "IMAGEBRANCHEXPANDED" uses "IMGEXPANDED"
 "IMGBLANK" and "IMGPAPER" are designed for use as "IMAGELEAF"

=head2 Simple Marking

Is the IUP::Tree default operation mode (MARKMODE=SINGLE). In this mode
only one node can be selected.

=head2 Multiple Marking

IUP::Tree allows marking several nodes simultaneously using the Shift and
Control keys. To use multiple marking set MARKMODE=MULTIPLE. In GTK and
Motif multiple nodes can also be selected using a rubber band if
SHOW_DRAGDROP=NO.

When a user keeps the Control key pressed, the individual marking mode
is used. This way, the focus node can be modified without changing the
marked node. To reverse a node marking, the user simply has to press
the space bar.

When the user keeps the Shift key pressed, the block marking mode is
used. This way, all nodes between the focus node and the initial node
are marked, and all others are unmarked. The initial node is changed
every time a node is marked without the Shift key being pressed. This
happens when any movement is done without Shift or Control keys being
pressed, or when the space bar is pressed together with Control.

=head2 X<navigation>Navigation

Using the keyboard:

=over

=item * B<Arrow Up/Down>: Moves the focus node to the neighbor node,
according to the arrow direction.

=item * B<Home/End>: Moves the focus node to the first/last node.

=item * B<Page Up/Page Down>: Moves the focus node to the node one
visible page above/below the focus node.

=item * B<Enter>: If the focus node is an expanded branch, it is
collapsed; if it is a collapsed branch, it is expanded; if it is a
leaf, it is executed.

=item * B<Ctrl+Arrow Up/Down>: Moves only the focus node.

=item * B<Ctrl+Space>: Marks or unmark the node at focus.

=item * B<F2>: Calls the rename callback or invoke the in place rename.

=item * B<Esc>: cancels in place rename.

=back

In Motif when pressing Tab the focus goes to the next visible node, if
there are no next visible node then the next control in the dialog
receives the focus. In Windows and GTK the focus simply goes directly
to the next control.

Using the left mouse button:

=over

=item * B<Clicking a node>: Moves the focus node to the clicked node.

=item * B<Clicking a (-/+) box>: Makes the branch to the right of the
(-/+) box collapse/expand.

=item * B<Double-clicking a node>: Moves the focus node to the clicked
node. If the node is an expanded branch, it is collapsed; if it is a
collapsed branch, it is expanded; if it is a leaf, it is executed.

=item * B<Clicking twice a node>: Calls the rename callback or invoke
the in place rename.

=item * B<Clicking and dragging a node>: if SHOWDRAGDROP=Yes starts a
drag. When mouse is released, the DRAGDROP_CB callback is called. If
the callback does not exist or if it returns IUP_CONTINUE then the node
is moved to the new position. If Ctrl is pressed then the node is
copied instead of moved. In Motif drag is performed with the middle
mouse button.

=back

=head2 Removing a Node with "Del"

By default the Del key is not processed, but you can implement it using
a simple K_ANY callback:

 int k_any(Ihandle* ih, int c)
 {
   if (c == K_DEL) 
    IUP::SetAttribute(ih,"DELNODE","MARKED");
   return IUP_CONTINUE;
 }

=head2 X<Extra_Functions>Extra Functions

IUP::Tree has functions that allow associating a pointer (or a user
defined id) to a node. In order to do that, you provide the id of the
node and the pointer (userid); even if the node's id changes later on,
the userid will still be associated with the given node. In IUP::Lua,
instead of a pointer the same functions are defined for table and
userdata. These functions use the B<USERDATAid> attribute.

----

 int IUP::TreeSetUserId(Ihandle *ih, int id, void *userid); [in C]
 iup.TreeSetUserId(ih: ihandle, id: number, userid: userdata/table) [in Lua]

B<ih>: Identifier of the interface element.

B<id>: Node identifier.

B<userid>: User pointer or Lua table to be associated with the node.
Use NULL (nil) value to remove the association.

Returns a non zero value if the node was found.

Associates an userid with a given id. If the id of the node is changed,
the userid remains the same.

Associations to Lua objects in Lua 5 are referenced in the Lua
REGISTRY. So they can be retrieved later. This means also that the
associated object will not be garbage collected until its reference is
removed. Also, the user should not use the same table to reference
different nodes (neither in the same nor across different trees.)

It is similar of setting the B<USERDATAid> attribute, but with the
additional feature of storing the Lua object in the registry.

 void* IUP::TreeGetUserId(Ihandle *ih, int id); [in C] 
 iup.TreeGetUserId(ih: ihandle, id: number) -> (ret: userdata/table) [in Lua]

B<ih>: Identifier of the interface element.

B<id>: Node identifier.

Returns the pointer or Lua table associated to the node or NULL if none
was associated. B<SetUserId> must have been called for the node with
the given id.

It is similar of retrieving the B<USERDATAid> attribute, but the Lua
object is retrieved from the REGISTRY.

 int IUP::TreeGetId(Ihandle *ih, void *userid); [in C] 
 iup.TreeGetId(ih: ihandle, userid: userdata/table) -> (ret: number) [in Lua]

B<ih>: Identifier of the interface element.

B<userid>: Pointer or Lua table associated to the node.

Returns the id of the node that has the userid on success or -1 (nil)
if not found. B<SetUserId> must have been called with the same userid.

----

Here are some utilities exclusive for Lua.

 iup.TreeAddNodes(ih: ihandle, tree: table, [id: number]) [in Lua]

B<ih>: Identifier of the interface element.

B<tree>: table of nodes.

B<id>: optional existing node. The default is the first (0).

Initializes the tree using the given Lua table as values for the tree
nodes using ADDBRANCH and ADDLEAF. For example:

 tree_nodes = 
 {
   branchname = "Figures",
   "Other",
   {
     branchname = "triangle",
     state = "COLLAPSED",
     "equilateral",
     "isoceles",
     "scalenus",
   },
   {
     branchname = "parallelogram",
     "square",
     { leafname = "diamond", color = "92 92 255", titlefont = "Courier, 14" },
   },
   { branchname = "2D" },
   { branchname = "3D" },
 }
 
 tree = iup.tree{}
 dlg = iup.dialog{tree}
 
 dlg:map()
 
 iup.TreeAddNodes(tree, tree_nodes)
 
 dlg:show()

Inside a table B<branchname> defines a branch and its title,
B<leafname> defines a leaf and its title. When a node inside a branch
is not a table then it is a leaf and only defines the leaf title. When
B<leafname> or B<branchname> are used you can also define other node
attributes: B<color>, B<state>, B<titlefont>, B<marked>, B<image> and
B<imageexpanded>; without specifying the node id. You can also use
B<userid> to associate an userdata or table just like in B<
iup.TreeSetUserId>. 

 iup.TreeSetNodeAttributes(ih: ihandle, id: number, attrs: table) [in Lua]

B<ih>: Identifier of the interface element.

B<id>: existing node.

B<tree>: table of attributes.

Sets a group of attributes stored in a table in the form attrs = {name
= value, ...}.

 iup.TreeSetAncestorsAttributes(ih: ihandle, id: number, attrs: table) [in Lua]

B<ih>: Identifier of the interface element.

B<id>: existing node.

B<tree>: table of attributes.

Calls B<iup.TreeSetNodeAttributes> for all ancestors of the given node
(not including the node).

 iup.TreeSetDescentsAttributes(ih: ihandle, id: number, attrs: table) [in Lua]

B<ih>: Identifier of the interface element.

B<id>: existing node.

B<tree>: table of attributes.

Calls B<iup.TreeSetNodeAttributes> for all descendents of the given
node (not including the node).

=head2 Utility Functions

These functions can be used to set and get attributes from the element:

 void  IUP::SetAttributeId(Ihandle *ih, const char* name, int id, const char* value);
 void  IUP::StoreAttributeId(Ihandle *ih, const char* name, int id, const char* value);
 char* IUP::GetAttributeId(Ihandle *ih, const char* name, int id);
 int   IUP::GetIntId(Ihandle *ih, const char* name, int id);
 float IUP::GetFloatId(Ihandle *ih, const char* name, int id);
 void  IUP::SetfAttributeId(Ihandle *ih, const char* name, int id, const char* format, ...);

They work just like the respective traditional set and get functions.
But the attribute string is complemented with the id value. For ex:

 IUP::SetAttributeId(ih, "KIND", 30, value) == IUP::SetAttribute(ih, "KIND30", value)
 IUP::SetAttributeId(ih, "ADDLEAF", 10, value) == IUP::SetAttribute(ih, "ADDLEAF10", value)

But these functions are faster than the traditional functions because
they do not need to parse the attribute name string and the application
does not need to concatenate the attribute name with the id.
