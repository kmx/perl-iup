[% h.name %]

[% n.iuptoggle %]

[% h.desc %]

Creates the toggle interface element. It is a two-state (on/off) button
that, when selected, generates an action that activates a function in
the associated application. Its visual representation can contain a
text or an image.

[% h.usage %]

[% h.create %]

 $toggle = IUP::Toggle->new(const char *title, const char *action);

B<title>: Text to be shown on the toggle. It can be NULL. It will set
the TITLE attribute.

B<action>: name of the action generated when the toggle is selected. It
can be NULL.

[% txt.new_attr %]

B<Returns:> the identifier of the created element, or C<undef> if an error occurs.

[% h.at %]

[%txt.at_intro%]

=over

=item * B<ALIGNMENT> (non inheritable)

horizontal and vertical alignment when
IMAGE is defined. Possible values: "ALEFT", "ACENTER" and "ARIGHT",
combined to "ATOP", "ACENTER" and "ABOTTOM". Default:
"ACENTER:ACENTER". Partial values are also accepted, like "ARIGHT" or
":ATOP", the other value will be used from the current alignment. In
Motif, vertical alignment is restricted to "ACENTER". In Windows works
only when Visual Styles is active. Text is always left aligned. (since
3.0)

=item * L<BGCOLOR|[%m.at%]/BGCOLOR>

Background color of toggle mark
when displaying a text. The text background is transparent, it will use
the background color of the native parent. When displaying an image in
Windows the background is ignored and the system color is used.
Default: the global attribute DLGBGCOLOR.

=item * B<CANFOCUS> (creation only) (non inheritable)

enables the focus
traversal of the control. In Windows the control will still get the
focus when clicked. Default: YES. 

=item * L<FGCOLOR|[%m.at%]/FGCOLOR>

Color of the text shown on the
toggle. In Windows, when using Visual Styles FGCOLOR is ignored.
Default: the global attribute DLGFGCOLOR.

=item * B<FLAT> (creation only)

Hides the toggle borders until the mouse enter
the toggle area when the toggle is not checked. If the toggle is
checked, then the borders will be shown even if flat is enabled. Used
only when IMAGE is defined. Can be YES or NO. Default: NO. (since iup-3.3)

=item * B<IMAGE> (non inheritable)

Image name. When the IMAGE attribute is
defined, the TITLE is not shown. This makes the toggle looks just like
a button with an image, but its behavior remains the same. Use L<
IUP::SetHandle|../func/iupsethandle.html> or L<
IUP::SetAttributeHandle|../func/iupsetattributehandle.html> to associate
an image to a name. See also L<IUP::Image|IUP::Image>. (GTK 2.6)

=item * B<IMPRESS> (non inheritable)

Image name of the pressed toggle. Unlike
buttons, toggles always display the button border when IMAGE and
IMPRESS are both defined. (GTK 2.6)

=item * B<IMINACTIVE> (non inheritable)

Image name of the inactive toggle. If
it is not defined but IMAGE is defined then for inactive toggles the
colors will be replaced by a modified version of the background color
creating the disabled effect. (GTK 2.6)

=item * B<MARKUP> [GTK only]

allows the title string to contains pango markup
commands. Works only if a mnemonic is NOT defined in the title. Can be
"YES" or "NO". Default: "NO".

=item * B<PADDING>

internal margin when IMAGE is defined. Works just like the
MARGIN attribute of the L<IUP::Hbox|IUP::Hbox> and L<IUP::Vbox|IUP::Vbox> containers, but uses
a different name to avoid inheritance problems. Default value: "0x0".


=item * B<RADIO> (read-only)

returns if the toggle is inside a radio. Can be
"YES" or "NO". Valid only after the element is mapped, before returns
NULL. 

=item * B<RIGHTBUTTON> (Windows Only) (creation only)

place the check button
at the right of the text. Can be "YES" or "NO". Default: "NO".

=item * B<VALUE> (non inheritable)

Toggle's state. Values can be "ON" or
"OFF". If 3STATE=YES then can also be "NOTDEF". Default: "OFF". In GTK
if you change the state of a radio, the unchecked toggle will receive
an ACTION callback notification.

=item * L<TITLE|[%m.at%]/TITLE> (non inheritable)

Toggle's text. If
IMAGE is not defined before map, then the default behavior is to
contain a text. The button behavior can not be changed after map. The
natural size will be larger enough to include all the text in the
selected font, even using multiple lines, plus the button borders or
check box if any. The '\n' character is accepted for line change. The
"&" character can be used to define a mnemonic, the next character will
be used as key. Use "&&" to show the "&" character instead on defining
a mnemonic. The toggle can be activated from any control in the dialog
using the "Alt+key" combination. (mnemonic support since iup-3.0)

=item * B<3STATE >(creation only)

Enable a three state toggle. Valid for
toggles with text only and that do not belong to a radio. Can be "YES"
or NO". Default: "NO".

=item * L<ACTION|[%m.cb%]/ACTION>

Action generated when the toggle's
state (on/off) was changed. The callback also receives the toggle's
state.

 int function(Ihandle* ih, int state); [in C]elem:action(state: number) -> (ret: number) [in Lua]

=over

B<$self:> reference to the element (IUP::XXXIUP_Toggle) that activated the event

B<$state:> 1 if the toggle's state was shifted to on; 0 if it was
shifted to off.

B<Returns:> IUP_CLOSE will be processed.

=back

=item * B<VALUECHANGED_CB>

Called after the value was interactively changed by
the user. Called after the ACTION callback, but under the same context.


 int function(Ihandle *ih); [in C]elem:valuechanged_cb() -> (ret: number) [in Lua]

=over

B<$self:> reference to the element (IUP::XXXIUP_Toggle) that activated the event

[% h.notes %]

Toggle with image or text can not change its behavior after mapped.
This is a creation attribute. But after creation the image can be
changed for another image, and the text for another text.

Toggles are activated using the Space key.

To build a set of mutual exclusive toggles, insert them in a
L<IUP::Radio|IUP::Radio> container. They must be inserted before creation, and their
behavior can not be changed. If you need to dynamically remove toggles
that belongs to a radio in Windows, then put the radio inside a
L<IUP::Frame|IUP::Frame> that has a title.
